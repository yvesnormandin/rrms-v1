after_model_callback — Root Agent

PURPOSE:
    Injects farewell text before end_session when the LLM calls end_session
    without saying anything first.

WHY THIS EXISTS:
    The LLM frequently calls end_session without producing any text, causing
    the customer to hear silence before the call disconnects. This callback
    ensures the customer always hears a goodbye message.

THE MULTI-MODEL-CALL PROBLEM:
    A single conversational "turn" can span MULTIPLE model calls. For example:
      - Model call 1: LLM produces text ("Thank you for calling!")
      - Model call 2: LLM calls payload_update_tool
      - Model call 3: LLM calls end_session (no text)

    The after_model_callback fires on EACH model call separately. A naive check
    for "no text in this response" would inject text on call 3 even though the
    agent already said something in call 1 — causing DOUBLE text.

FIX:
    Use callback_context.events to check if the agent already produced text in
    a prior model call within the same turn. Only inject if no text was produced
    anywhere in the current turn.

KEY PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED:
    1. text_or_transcript(): Use instead of part.text for audio-safe detection.
       In audio mode, the LLM produces transcripts, not text. text_or_transcript()
       handles both.
    2. callback_context.events: Full session event history. Walk backwards from
       the most recent event to find the last user message; if any agent event
       between now and then has text, the agent already spoke.
    3. Prepend text before end_session: Put the farewell Part BEFORE the
       end_session Part so the customer hears it first.

PLATFORM GLOBALS (do NOT import these):
    CallbackContext, Content, Part, LlmResponse, LlmRequest are auto-provided
    by the GECX sandbox at runtime. Only standard library imports need explicit
    import statements.
